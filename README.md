Pirate Intelligent Agent – Treasure Hunt Game
Project Overview

This project implements a pirate intelligent agent designed to navigate a maze and find treasure before the player. The environment is modeled as an 8x8 grid containing open spaces, blocked cells, and a treasure goal at the bottom-right corner. The pirate begins at the top-left and must use reinforcement learning to discover the optimal path to the treasure.

The agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with experience replay and a neural network built in TensorFlow/Keras. The project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to a classic pathfinding problem.

Work Completed

Code Provided:

TreasureEnvironment.py: Defines the maze environment, including movement rules, rewards, penalties, and game termination conditions.

GameExperience.py: Implements the experience replay memory to store episodes and sample training data.

Starter neural network model code: Provided a basic function to build and compile the Q-learning model.

Visualization and helper utilities: Functions for displaying the environment and testing trained agents.

Code I Created:

Implemented the Deep Q-Learning training loop (qtrain function) inside the Jupyter Notebook.

Added logic for exploration vs. exploitation using epsilon-greedy action selection.

Integrated experience replay into training by storing episodes and sampling mini-batches to update the model.

Controlled stopping conditions based on win rate and completion checks.

Tuned hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, epsilon decay) to achieve a 100% win rate.

Reflection and Connection to Computer Science
What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists design and implement solutions to problems that are too complex, repetitive, or large for humans to handle efficiently. In this case, the pirate agent demonstrates how an AI system can solve navigation and optimization problems without explicit step-by-step instructions. This matters because the same principles apply to real-world problems such as robotics, logistics, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles, where intelligent agents must adapt and optimize in dynamic environments.

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by:

Defining the problem clearly – in this case, navigating a maze to maximize reward.

Breaking it down into components – environment rules, agent behavior, feedback signals.

Choosing an appropriate algorithm – reinforcement learning with DQN to handle sequential decisions.

Testing and iteration – adjusting parameters and validating results until the agent reached 100% success.

This structured problem-solving approach mirrors how real-world AI projects are developed and optimized.

What Are My Ethical Responsibilities?

Ethics plays a critical role in AI development. For this project, the stakes were small (a pirate finding treasure), but the underlying technology—reinforcement learning agents—has broader implications. My ethical responsibilities include:

Transparency: Designing algorithms that can be explained and understood by users.

Fairness and Bias Awareness: Ensuring systems do not inherit unfair biases from training data.

Privacy: Respecting and protecting user data if an agent collects personal information.

Reliability: Building agents that behave consistently and predictably, especially when safety is a factor.

In an organizational context, I must ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly, balancing innovation with societal impact.

Conclusion

This project gave me hands-on experience applying Deep Q-Learning to a pathfinding problem, combining theory from reinforcement learning with practical implementation in Python. More importantly, it reinforced the mindset of thinking like a computer scientist: defining problems, designing algorithms, reflecting on outcomes, and considering ethical responsibilities.
